### Project: Analysis and Performance Tracking of MoMo's Mobile Topup Service

**1. Purpose:**
The project aims to analyze and track the performance of MoMo's Mobile Topup service, which includes the "Nạp tiền điện thoại" and "Mua mã thẻ di động" options. This analysis will help in understanding user demographics, transaction behavior, and trends, thereby providing valuable insights to enhance service performance and inform marketing strategies.

**2. Data Preparation:**
The project will utilize data from three tables: 'Commission', 'Transactions', and 'User_Info'. The key steps involve integrating and enriching these datasets to facilitate comprehensive analysis.

**3. Steps and Methodology:**

1. **Revenue Calculation:**
   - Add a 'Revenue' column in the 'Transactions' table to display MoMo's earned revenue for each order. This is calculated using the 'Commission' table, which provides the commission rates for each transaction type.
   - Calculate MoMo's total revenue for January 2020 by summing up the 'Revenue' column for all transactions in that month.

2. **Profitability Analysis:**
   - Identify MoMo's most profitable month by analyzing the monthly revenue data.
   - Determine the day of the week when MoMo makes the most and least money, on average, by analyzing daily revenue patterns.

3. **User Demographics Integration:**
   - Combine the 'User_Info' table with the 'Transactions' table to add columns for Age, Gender, Location, and Type_user (New/Current).
   - Calculate the total number of new users in December 2020 by filtering and counting the relevant entries.

4. **Dashboard Design:**
   - Design a performance-tracking dashboard that includes various metrics such as monthly revenue, transaction volume, average transaction value, new vs. returning users, and demographic breakdowns (age, gender, location).
   - Use data visualization tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau) to create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard.

5. **Observations and Insights:**
   - Analyze the provided data to identify trends, classifications, and insights related to user demographics and transaction behavior.
   - Provide detailed observations about factors influencing user behavior, peak transaction periods, and demographic patterns.

**4. Insights and Recommendations:**
Based on the analysis, the following observations and insights can be drawn:

- **User Demographics:** Identify key demographic groups that contribute most to the Topup service revenue. For example, age groups or locations with high transaction volumes.
- **Transaction Behavior:** Analyze transaction patterns to identify peak periods, such as specific days of the week or times of the month when transactions spike.
- **Profitability Trends:** Determine which months or periods are most profitable and investigate potential reasons behind these trends.

**5. Marketing Recommendations:**
- **Targeted Campaigns:** Design promotion campaigns that target high-value demographic groups identified in the analysis. For example, offer discounts or special offers to frequent users or users in high-revenue locations.
- **Timing Promotions:** Schedule marketing campaigns to coincide with peak transaction periods to maximize impact.
- **User Retention:** Develop strategies to convert new users into regular customers by offering loyalty rewards, personalized offers, and excellent customer service.

**Conclusion:**
The project will provide a comprehensive analysis of MoMo's Mobile Topup service, offering valuable insights into user demographics and transaction behavior. The performance-tracking dashboard will enable continuous monitoring and improvement of the service, while the marketing recommendations will help drive increased user engagement and revenue.
